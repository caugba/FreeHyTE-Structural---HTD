% EDGEREFINEMENT computes the values of the global and local selection
% criteria for the essential boundary 'index'. It assumes that the basis
% is enriched independently by adding one single function to it. 
% The values of the selection criteria are stored in the List.Edge 
% matrix, and the edges are ranked according to the selection criterion
% chosen by the user.
%
% EdgeRefinement is called by MAIN*** when the p-adaptive processes is 
% launched.
% Input data:
% * the Edges, Loops, BConds and List data structures; 
% * the matrix of coefficients before the refinement, LSH0;
% * the thermal energy before the refinement, Energy0; 
% * the solution vector X; 
% * the dimension of the solving system before the refinement, Dim;
% * the boundary to be refined, index;
% * the current iteration counter, iteration; 
% * the list with the thermal energy of all previous iteration, EnergyIteration;
% * the SelectionCriterion selected by the user in the GUI;
% * the Gauss-Legendre integration parameters abscissa and weights. 
% Output/Returns to MAIN*** :
% the List structure with the List.Edges updated (edges that were selected 
% for refinement), and the updated Loops and Egdes structures.

% Boundary refinement criteria are global, monitoring the solution energy 
% variation, or local, monitoring the boundary balance residual.
% The solution energy variation criterion selects for refinement the 
% boundary that causes the largest relative variation of the solution
% energy.
% What is typical for the hybrid-Trefftz formulations is that they not 
% produce "kinematically" or "statically" admissible solutions and the 
% monotonous convergence of the energy does not generally occur, meaning 
% that the solution energy oscillates in the vicinity of the exact solution 
% as it converges. 
% In alternative, the boundary balance residual criterion selects for 
% refinement the boundary where adding one shape function would cause the 
% largest improvement of the displacement balance of all essential
% boundaries of the mesh.
% The definition and computation of the selection criteria are covered in
% reference [2] (section 6.3), reference [3] (section 4.3), and reference
% [4] (section 4.6.1).
